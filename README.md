## FAQ

### What will you do during the event?

We will write pi symbols on the street with
street chalk. When with a group, we usually
split the street into sections (left, right,
middle), that each person will write his/her
pi symbols on.

### Do I need to bring street chalk?

Preferably yes. But we will be happy to share
out stash of street chalk with anyone to join
in on the celabration, so we can go back to
sleep earlier.

### What if it rains?

If street chalk is useless against the weather, 
we abandon this celebration and go back to sleep

### What do you do after the celebration?

We go back to sleep, so we can be fit on Pi Day
during working hours.

### Do you make pictures?

Usually not. Instead, we collect screenshots of
social media responses.
